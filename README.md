# 🦆🦜🦢 Only 🐓 Birds 🦤🦩🦃🦉

Birding is like catching real-life Pokémon: you try to encounter as many as possible and want 
to keep a log of the birds you've seen. But unlike Pokémon, there's a distinct lack of cool 
apps to support birders in keeping a log. **So let's make a cool modern birding app!**

**OnlyBirds** allows you to quickly log encounters with birds with autocompletion. You can
then see your encounters in list and map views.
